# Development Notes

Technical implementation details and configuration decisions.

## Project Timeline

**Phase 1: Playwright Setup**

- Initial framework configuration
- Page Object pattern implementation
- Cross-browser testing setup

**Phase 2: Cucumber Integration**

- BDD scenario implementation
- Step definition mapping
- Gherkin feature file creation

**Phase 3: Cypress Implementation**

- E2E test suite development
- Custom command library
- Mobile testing integration

## Technical Decisions

### Test Site Selection

**SauceDemo for Playwright:**

- Stable selectors with data-test attributes
- Consistent application state
- Designed for automation testing

**Automation Exercise for Cypress:**

- Live e-commerce functionality
- API endpoints for mixed testing
- Real-world application behavior

### Architecture Patterns

**Page Object Model:**

- Centralized selector management
- Reusable component abstraction
- Maintainable test structure

**Custom Commands (Cypress):**

- Reduced code duplication
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Enhanced test readability

## Implementation Challenges

### Test Data Management

- Dynamic data generation requirements
- Environment-specific test data
- Data cleanup and isolation

### Browser Compatibility

- Cross-browser selector differences
- Timing variations between browsers
- Mobile viewport testing considerations

### Framework Integration

- Cucumber step definition complexity
- Async/await handling in Playwright
- Custom command organization in Cypress

## Configuration Details

### Environment Setup

- Node.js version management
- Browser installation automation
- Dependency management across projects

### Reporting Integration

- HTML report generation
- Screenshot capture on failures
- Test execution video recording

  - Network timeouts on slow connections
  - Learned importance of proper waits vs hard sleeps

**Debugging**

- Playwright traces are great once you know about them
- Cypress time-travel debugging is genuinely helpful

## Things I'd Do Differently

- Start with simpler tests before jumping into complex scenarios
- Set up proper CI/CD integration from the beginning
- Better test reporting and failure notifications
- More focus on API testing alongside UI tests

## Next Experiments

Ideas for future learning:

- Mobile testing with Appium
- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing integration
- Database testing scenarios
- Better test data factories

## Useful Commands I Keep Forgetting

```bash
# Playwright debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Cypress headed mode for debugging
npx cypress run --headed --no-exit

# Generate Playwright traces
npx playwright test --trace on

# Run specific test by name
npx cypress run --spec "**/login.cy.js"
```
